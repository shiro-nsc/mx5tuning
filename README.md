I have written this Python code that reads the fuel map data from a 1994-1995 Mazda MX-5 Miata, converts it into an air-fuel ratio map, and finally displays a 3D graph.

Instructions:

The data file must be converted from binary to HEX and saved in CSV format. Sample data (fuel_map.csv) is attached here.
Run the Python code and specify the location of the data file when prompted. The program will then display the air-fuel ratio map and the 3D graph.

Originally, this was an additional research assignment for my IT certificate program at a local community college. However, writing this code in Python has been a good practice and enjoyable.

Research Python Libraries or Framework:

It's purely my hobby, but I've found Python to be a great platform to experiment with. I've owned my 1994 Mazda Miata for over 20 years. Around two decades ago, when I first bought the car, I attempted to modify its fuel map and timing map in the ECU (Engine Control Unit) for performance/fuel economy. Like the most of the '90s cars, my Miata's ECU data stored in a 28-pin EEPROM (I believe it was 256 bytes). 

*Nowadays, modern cars have ECUs with flash memory, allowing you to connect your laptop to the OBDII port to modify the data without a ROM writer. The method I tried was quite old-school and not commonly practiced anymore.

At that time, I tried to develop my own ROM editor using the Windows API. However, I eventually gave up on creating the application myself and use Excel to change the data manually.

During my research, I came across Matplotlib, a versatile library for data visualization. Matplotlib provides a wide range of tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. As a beginner, I found Matplotlib to be user-friendly and easy to use, making it a perfect fit for my hobby projects involving graph data visualization.

I've included some screenshots of sample programs utilizing Matplotlib.

In conclusion, my exploration of Python libraries like Matplotlib has been both enlightening and rewarding. We're in the era of cloud computing, so I plan to explore Cloud APIs and frameworks instead of relying solely on Windows APIs. The accessibility of resources like Matplotlib's documentation has empowered me to embark on exciting hobby projects involving data visualization. Moving forward, I'm eager to continue expanding my Python skills and utilizing libraries like Matplotlib to bring my project ideas to life.
